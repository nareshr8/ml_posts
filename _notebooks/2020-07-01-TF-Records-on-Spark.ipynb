    "- Data was stored in SSD (both CSV and TF-Records) which by itself does faster reads. Hence the impact of TF-Records being read faster became less predominant\n",
    "- Training time for tabular batch are typically slow compared to image data as tabular data has fewer features. (making our performance bottle neck CPU bound)\n",

    "For instance, GPU which does the training might be waiting for the CPU to get the training data for each batch, if the training finishes before retrieving the data for the next batch. This makes the performance bottle-neck *CPU bound*. \n",
